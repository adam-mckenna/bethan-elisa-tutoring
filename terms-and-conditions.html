          Terms and Conditions
        </h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">
          Welcome to Bethan Elisa Tutoring Services
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          By booking and attending our classes, you agree to the following terms
          and conditions:
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Platform for Classes</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          All tutoring sessions are conducted exclusively via Zoom. It is the
          client's responsibility to ensure they have a stable internet
          connection and the necessary software installed to participate in
          these sessions.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. Booking and Payment</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          All classes must be booked and paid for at least 48 hours in advance
          of the scheduled session. Payments are processed exclusively through
          PayPal. Clients are responsible for ensuring their PayPal account is
          set up and funded appropriately to avoid any delays.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          3. Rescheduling and Cancellations
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          If you need to reschedule a class, please provide at least 24 hours'
          notice. I will do my best to accommodate your request based on
          availability. Cancellations made less than 24 hours before the
          scheduled class time will not be eligible for a refund. In the event
          of a timely cancellation (more than 24 hours in advance), you may
          choose to reschedule or receive a credit towards a future class.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Refund Policy</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Refunds are not provided for missed classes or last-minute
          cancellations (less than 24 hours before the class). If a session is
          cancelled by the tutor, you will be given the option to reschedule or
          receive a full refund.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          5. Conduct and Behaviour
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Clients are expected to maintain respectful and appropriate behaviour
          during sessions. Any form of harassment, abuse, or misconduct will
          result in immediate termination of services without a refund.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">6. Liability</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          While I strive to provide the highest quality tutoring services,
          Bethan Elisa Tutoring is not responsible for any technical issues that
          may arise during a Zoom session due to the client’s hardware,
          software, or internet connection. Liability is limited to the amount
          paid for the specific session in question.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          7. Privacy and Confidentiality
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          All personal information shared during the booking process will be
          kept confidential and used solely for the purpose of providing
          tutoring services. Sessions may not be recorded or shared without
          explicit permission from both the tutor and the client.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">8. Amendments</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          I reserve the right to amend these terms and conditions at any time.
          Clients will be notified of any significant changes.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6">
          By booking a session, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
          and agreed to these terms and conditions. If you have any questions or
          need further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact.
